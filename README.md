> .gitignore allows for file exclusions when pushing to a branch. This will leave files out of commits which allows a developer to have full control of pushes. When working on certain files, a dev does not want to push some other files which are out of scope.

- In the ReadME.md, explain the 
storage of credentials and sensitive 
information

> When data breaches occur on massive companies and passwords are stored in plain text, this will allow any malicious party to do credential stuffing on any other website that the users of the breached company use. Many people don't use different passwords for different websites. This is why companies should encrypt passwords to make it harder for malicious parties to decrypt the passwords of the users. SHA-2 is a common encryption method used for passwords in databases, seen in past breaches.
